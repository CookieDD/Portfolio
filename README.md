A self-intro webpage build from React.

Used useContext hook method to deal with the state change, in order to change the theme(between dark and light);

Used framer-motion to realise the animation effects on the cards, used react-scroll to realise the smooth scroll effect.

Used swiper to realise the slide show effect, emailJS for the email funcionality in Contact section.

Inspired by and followed the steps from the YouTube channel ZAINKEEPSCODE;
